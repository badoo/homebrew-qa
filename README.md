# Homebrew tap with various bottles for QA

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tap for binary packages ([Bottles](https://docs.brew.sh/Bottles)) of various formulae related to QA.

Formulae here are NOT in sync with official brew formulae from [Homebrew repo](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) and other repos for reason of easier deployment.

Formulae here contain bottles of: 
* old frozen versions
* yet unreleased versions (HEAD)
* not official (i.e. forked) and patched versions
